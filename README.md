# pandas-challenge

I used Pandas to analyze standardized test results in schools. I created district and school summaries, ranked top and bottom performers, and examined performance by grade, spending, size, and type. The Jupyter notebook and results are in the 'pandas-challenge' repository. the analysis is called:
PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb
